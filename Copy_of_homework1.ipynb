This is because the data we are using is taken from physical examinations of participants, which is often only performed in a controlled/at-home environment. Based on ethical concerns and population limitations, this makes the data pool rather small.\n",

        "In terms of the actual quantity of the data, the majority of the features from the NNYFS datasets were measured in a controlled environment. This standardization of physical examination procedures ensured higher quality of the data. One exception is the sleep-awake time data, where participants wore a physical activity monitor in an at-home setting. This lead to both loss of data, and non-standardized measurements that could affect the calculated sleep-awake time features."
