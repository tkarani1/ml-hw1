This is because the data we are using is taken from physical examinations of participants, which is often only performed in a controlled/at-home environment. Based on ethical concerns and population limitations, this makes the data pool rather small. Additionally, many participants had NaN values for certain physical measurements, and some participants did not complete the entirety of the physical examinations. We had to remove the instances for which data was missing, which also lead to a loss in quantity.\n",
        "\n",
        "In terms of the actual quality of the data, the majority of the features from the NNYFS datasets were measured in a controlled environment. This standardization of physical examination procedures ensured higher quality of the data. One exception is the sleep-awake time data, where participants wore a physical activity monitor in an at-home setting. This lead to both loss of data, and non-standardized measurements that could affect the calculated sleep-awake time features."
